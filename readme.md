If you're here, you probably know that there *will* come a time as a developer or a manager/leader where you'll be involved the interview process. It may have happened, or is about to happen, or you're already been-there/done-that.

This repo contains a growing collection of pretty decent interview questions that I've put together. Some of these I ~~stole~~ borrowed from various online sources, some from companies I've worked for, but a lot are my own items that I've pulled together from my own experiences, both as a developer and as a development manager.

I won't bore you with an explanation of each section, as the files should seem pretty self-evident.

Also, I don't believe in tests in an interview. Why would you want to judge or be judged by a contrived scenario on the spot? Instead, though, I do believe in working on problems together and trying to get an idea of how the candidate approaches a problem and what questions they ask, so there's that.

## Some Interview Tips

### Start slow, and remember, it's personal (so make it so)

The candidate's a person, not a resource. If you were to hire them you'll probably be working with them throughout the day, so get to know them. Where are they from? What gets them up in the morning? What do they do? (vs what work they do -- those are separate items for many normal people)

### Explain the Interview Process

Why are we speaking? What are **you** hoping to get out of this process, and invite them to ask questions.


### Coax, Don't Ambush

Work answers out of them, but not to ambush or surprise/shock them. 

Don't be afraid to volunteer your own answer from your own experience -- it helps to show you're a person, and that you're open to talking about your own experiences.

### Open-Ended Questions

Unless you're playing a board game, you find out nothing asking yes/no, true/false, A/B questions. Ask the question without knowing the answer and then shut up, sit back, and let them answer and see where it takes you both.

### You're Not A Lawyer, So Ask What You Don't Know

It's ok for you to not expect or know the answer. Go with it.

### Actively Listen, and Incorporate Their Responses

The interview should have a lot of give-and-take, and use their responses to guide where you'll go next in the session.
