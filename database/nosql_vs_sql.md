# NoSQL vs SQL

## Q: diffs between nosql and relational dbms

A:
* In terms of data format, NoSQL does not follow any order for its data format. Whereas, RDBMS is more organized and structured when it comes to the format of its data.

* When it comes to scalability, NoSQL is more very good and more scalable. Whereas, RDBMS is average and less scalable than NoSQL.

* For querying of data, NoSQL is limited in terms of querying because there is no join clause present in NoSQL. Whereas, querying can be used in RDBMS as it uses the structured query language.

* The difference in the storage mechanism of NoSQL and RDBMS is that, NoSQL uses key value pair, documents, column storage, etc. for storage. Whereas, RDBMS uses various tables for storing data and relationships.

## Q: List the different kinds of NoSQL data stores.
The variety of NoSQL data stores available which are widely distributed are categorized into four categories. They are: –

### Key value store
it is a simple data storage key system which uses keys to access different values.
### Column family store
it is a sparse matrix system. It uses columns and rows as keys.
### Graph store
it is used in case of relationships-intensive problems.
### Document stores
it is used for storing hierarchical data structures directly in the database.

## Q:  What are the pros and cons of a graph database under NoSQL databases?

## A:
Following are the pros and cons of a graph database which is a type of NoSQL databases: –

### Pros of using graph database:
* These are tailor-made for the networking applications. A social network is a good example of this.
* They can also be perfect for an object-oriented programming system.

### Cons of using graph database:
* Since the degree of interconnection between nodes is high in graph database, so it is not suitable for network partitioning.
* Also, graph databases don’t scale out well in NoSQL databases.
