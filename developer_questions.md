concentrate on both soft and hard skills
learn what is the problem you're trying to solve
how will it be used?

## Priorities to be best dev you can be?
1. secure by default -- identity management
2. experiment with bleeding edge tools
3. struggle to learn new languages & tech
4. keep aware of AWS announcements

---

## Where do you get information about what's new?
1. some time reading/exploring outside 9-to-5
2. news aggregation sites
3. evil experiments

## Q: [team dynamics] What's the most important skill we could teach new coders?
## A:
(https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-write-better-code)

working well with others on a shared code base



## Q: follow-up -- what are some ways you can help with this?
## A: (see below)
1. **pair programming** -- requires training, and some of the best instructors use pair programming as part of their training
2. **code reviews** -- lots of pair programming may mitigate the importance of this, but however it's done it shouldn't be neglected
3. **patience** -- it's easy to get into arguments when pair programming, just as it's easy to end up simply telling someone what to type. When pair programming and you see someone making a mistake, see if he/she spots it themselves
4. **humility** -- fight the urge to convince others to write only clean code and wage a holy war; this assumes you're right and they're wrong. If your pair wants to do something that you think is wrong, try indulging them -- at worst, you get to teach them something; at best, you'll learn something new.

## Q: followup -- any technical skills?
## A: simple design, low coupling
1. SOLID design principles
2. TDD (test-driven development) 
3. thinking about release & how the code will live
4. don't be afraid to delete your code (thinking about refactoring)
5. think about complexity of the code -- static analysis
6.
