## Q: follow-up -- what are some ways you can help with this?
## A: (see below)
1. **pair programming** -- requires training, and some of the best instructors use pair programming as part of their training
2. **code reviews** -- lots of pair programming may mitigate the importance of this, but however it's done it shouldn't be neglected
3. **patience** -- it's easy to get into arguments when pair programming, just as it's easy to end up simply telling someone what to type. When pair programming and you see someone making a mistake, see if he/she spots it themselves
4. **humility** -- fight the urge to convince others to write only clean code and wage a holy war; this assumes you're right and they're wrong. If your pair wants to do something that you think is wrong, try indulging them -- at worst, you get to teach them something; at best, you'll learn something new.

## Q: followup to the above -- any technical skills you (or we) could impart?
## A: simple design, low coupling
1. SOLID design principles
2. TDD (test-driven development)
