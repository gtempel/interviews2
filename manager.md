- Give an example of a situation where you anticipated potential challenges and developed preventive solutions.

  This question can show the interviewer how you apply your problem-solving and critical thinking skills to overcome challenges and achieve success. Use an example from a past experience that highlights your strategies, how you solved the problem and what the outcome was.

  *Example: "At the start of my most recent development project, I found potential compatibility issues between the company's OS and the application I was working on. Before I started initiating project tasks, though, I was able to identify ways to bypass the incompatibility features between the OS and the application."*
 
- What was a difficult decision you had to make in your current or past role?

  Managers in any industry must sometimes make difficult decisions, and the interviewer will likely want to know how you approach the decision-making process. Demonstrate your ability to evaluate information, form conclusions and make choices.

  *Example: "In my last role, I had to make the choice of whether to keep a gifted engineer on my team or to let them go. They continuously demonstrated negativity on the team, even though their work was exceptional. Ultimately, I kept them on the team by compromising with them to work independently most of the time. This was a difficult, but necessary decision as this particular team member continued to produce amazing outcomes for the company."*
 
- How do you break down large, complex projects for your team?

  Software development projects can be very large in scope, and the interviewer will want to get an idea of how you start projects and direct your team to completion. Describe your process for delegating tasks, scheduling timelines and budgeting costs for development projects.

  *Example: "I first analyze the project outline, which tells me what the customer wants at completion. Then I assess what resources and tools my team will need to complete the project. After assessing the budget, I break down large tasks into smaller, weekly objectives that I then delegate to the team to start working on. During each phase, I check in with my team to measure our progress, check for ongoing quality and eliminate potential problems."*
